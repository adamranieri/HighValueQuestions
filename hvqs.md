## SQL Queries
Associates should be able to perform a variety of SQL queries. This appears to be the most popular way of assessing SQL abilities. Rather than trying to come up with specific questions they should do these to get practical experience. There is a high chance you will be asked to write a SQL query. The chinook database is a practice database. Run the script here in your DB to get it.
